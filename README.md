Student Registration Form 📝
This project is a simple and clean student registration form built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to fill in basic student information like name, age, gender, course, and email. Once the form is submitted, the details are added to a table displayed below the form.

The main purpose of this project is to practice working with forms, client-side validation, dynamic DOM manipulation, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

What it does:
Lets users fill out a form with student details

Displays submitted data in a table format

Adds a Delete button for each entry so rows can be removed

Hides the table initially, then shows it after the first save

Includes a background image with a transparent-style form for a modern look

Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile screens

Tech used:
HTML – to structure the form and table

Tailwind CSS – for responsive and utility-first styling

JavaScript – to handle form submission, DOM updates, and deletion

Why I built this:
I created this project to improve my frontend development skills, especially around working with forms, layout using Tailwind, and basic interactivity with JavaScript. It’s a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates real-world UI behavior.
